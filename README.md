# EDA-App-Insights-Analysis
TOOL USED: COLAB
This dataset contains different mobile applications from the Google Play Store.
We cleaned the data by removing missing values, converting data types, fixing text formats (like Installs, Price, and Size), removing duplicates, and converting the date column into proper datetime format.
After cleaning, we studied the apps based on their ratings, installs, categories, content ratings, free vs paid comparison, reviews count, app size impact, category wise popularity and update patterns over time.

Our analysis helped us understand which type of apps perform better, which categories are more preferred by users, how app installs relate with app quality, and which genres get higher ratings.
This analysis gives useful business insights that can help app developers, marketers and product teams to make better decisions, choose correct pricing models, focus on high performing categories and improve user satisfaction in future app launches.
